# How to contribute to MagicAKS

First of all thank you. Collectively we can remove the drudgery associated with running AKS/K8s clusters.

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/magicaks/magicaks/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/magicaks/magicaks/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please double check on the current coding conventions used.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a [new issue](https://github.com/magicaks/magicaks/issues/new) so we can first discuss the changes there. After the discussion you may send a PR with relevant changes. Do not send a PR without discussion on an issue.

## **Do you want to contribute to the MagicAKS documentation?**

* Awesome, please make sure the steps you offer are independently verified first. Add screenshots when appropriate. File a PR when ready.

MagicAKS is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
